The Ising model was developed by William Lenz and further worked on by Ernest Ising. In this project, the Ising model is used to describe a two dimensional magnetic system. The system is modeled as a spin matrix, were each spin has the value 1 or -1.

These laws are not enough to solve the motion of the planets. From the laws one can derive differential equations for the motion, which are not trivial or even possible to solve analytically. This is where computational methods are useful. With the tools developed in computtational physics we can make a prediction to the motion of the planets in our solar system.\footnote{\href{http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/h17/index.html}{\color{blue}{Semester page for FYS3150 - Autumn 2017}}.} And because of our assignment we kind of have to do this to pass the course.\cite{project4}
