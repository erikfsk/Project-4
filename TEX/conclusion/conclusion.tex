The program has been tested with the analytical solution for a 2x2 grid of spins. A 20x20 matrix was tested for convergence. The convergence result was used for future calculations. For finding $T_C$ extrapolation and equation \ref{eq:t-c} was used on the dataset from 20,60,100,140 and 200 lattices. \footnote{Assignment asked for 40,60,100 and 140. I toke the liberty to use a different set of L values and a different T interval.} From the equation the best result was 2.699 and from extrapolation 2.261 was obtained. From literature the exact result is known as approximatively 2.269.\cite{onsager}

For future work one should calculate more exact values of the transition states for the finite lattices. This takes a lot of computational power, but will in exchange yield a better result.\footnote{Hopefully}
