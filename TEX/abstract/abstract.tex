Phase transition for a two dimensional magnetic system was studied using the Ising model and the Metropolis algorithm. The Program was confirmed to work by the analytical result of a 2x2 matrix. For stability and convergence a 20x20 lattice was used. The critical temperature $T_C$ for a infinite was approximated through simualations of many different lattices. $T_C$ was approximated to 2.2699\footnote{See table \ref{tab:t-c}}, which is close to the analytical prediction of Lars Onsager.\cite{onsager}
