\subsection{Metropolis algorithm}

The metropolis algorithm only has a few steps. First, pick one site in the matrix of spins. This process need to be random. For that site, calculate the energy difference if the spin is flipped. Then the algorithm decide whether to flip the spin or not. This is decided based on the energy difference. If the difference is negative flip, then flip the spin. If not, then pick a random number between 0 and 1 and if this number is less then $e^{-\beta \Delta E}$ flip the spin. Else keep the spin. Finally update expectation values.
